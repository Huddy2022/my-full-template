# Mr Very First Website

Welcome! [code institute](https://codeinstitute.net)

My full template was my example of starting my very first web page. The basic design was to create a web page with multiple pages linked with easy access to demonstrate the skills involed in web development. 

## Features

* ### Navigation bar
  * This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button.
  * Featured on all three pages are the streams which each have their own logos which link to their specific wikipedia pages, which will open on new tabs.

* ### Stream one
  * In stream one there are five images all of which have their one links to their specific criteria  

* ### Stream Two
  * Similar to stream one but has three images for javascript, git and github and their relevant links

* ### Stream Three
  * Very similar to stream one with five images all releating to their specfic criteria and all of which will open on a new tab.
